Without limiting the foregoing , to enroll to the second cycle, it is necessary to have 
successfully passed all the modules corresponding to 75% of the first cycle credits. 
This percentage may be reduced, specifically in particular or special cases by the Teaching 
Commission of the Center. 
 
1.C 
Teaching Period 
A teaching period of five years is determined in the Studies Plan.

The change from the old program to the new one allows the student to recognize the old 
modules in order to incorporate them to the new one. To this end, the adaptation between the 
Plan of 1984 and the present one is regulated by the Board of Equivalents, which is 
accompanied, without any prejudice that any other validation not included in the present Board 
must be decided in any case by the Validation Commission.
