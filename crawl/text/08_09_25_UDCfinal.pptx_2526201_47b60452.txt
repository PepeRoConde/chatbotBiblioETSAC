Enrolling in a course

Casa do Estudantado
Campus de Elviña

• You will get a copy of the courses you are
enrolled in and your password for
Campus Virtual
 https://udconline.udc.gal
• Check that you have access to all of your
courses.  
• If you cannot log in a course, it means
that you are not enrolled in the course.

Course offer and syllabus
• Make sure the course code is right. Example:
• Bachelor’s Degree Courses
• You can select courses from 
several degrees.
• Make sure schedules are 
compatible.
• Check the grading policy for
each course. 
• For example:

Microeconomics
Degree Code Course
ADE/Business Administration 611G02001 Principles of
Microeconomics
Economía/Economics 611G01001 Principles of
Microeconomics
Empresariales 650G01002 Principles of

VERY IMPORTANT!!
Check in your enrollment document that the codes
match. This year UDC is updating the course codes, so 
there are two codes for each course. Make sure they
are correct.
Most likely, in your enrollment document you will find
one code and a different one in the learning agreement. 
Please check that they refer to the same course.

Horarios de las asignaturas en español
• Si eliges cursos en español, 
encontrarás, en la mayoría de 
los casos, varios grupos para 
la misma asignatura → 
puedes escoger el grupo para 
poder compatibilizar horarios.
• Importante: Estás inscrito en 
el curso pero no en un grupo. 
Los primeros días de clase

profesor/a de que asistirás a 
su grupo.

Schedule courses taught in Spanish

you will find, in most cases, several 
groups for the same course → you 
can choose to go to the group you wish.

course but not in a group. The first days 
of class you have to inform the 
teacher you will be attending his/her 
group.

Only one change in your learning agreement  per

to take some time, go to the class for a week and 
make sure you want to keep that course.
Who must
sign the
LA?
The changes in the learning agreement have to 
be signed by the student and by the Erasmus
