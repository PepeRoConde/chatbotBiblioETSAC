HRS4R (Human Resources Strategy for Researchers)
As part of its commitment to bring the best researching talent, Universidade da Coruña endorsed in August 2016 the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers that sets out the rules and obligations of researchers, their employers and funders, to apply fair and transparent recruitment procedures.
The University present its Application for acknowledgement of Human Resources in Research on November 15th 2016 and obtained the "HR Excellence in Research" award on June 7th 2017. On July 8th, 2019, the UDC successfully passed the Implementation Phase Interim Assessment of the HRS4R award by Euraxess.
On November 15th, 2022 and after the visit of the group of HRS4R evaluators, the European Commission informed the UDC of the renewal of the HR Award for another 3 years, with the date of the next evaluation being November 15th, 2025.
The UDC has been working strongly on the implementation of the measures contained in the 2022-2025 Action Plan, and it is currently awaiting for the result of this new renewal.
The "HR Excellence in Research" award gives public recognition to research institutions that have made progress in aligning their Human Resources policies with the principles set out in the "Charter & Code". Institutions that have been awarded have the right to use the icon to highlight their commitment to implement fair and transparent recruitment and appraisal procedures for researchers.
