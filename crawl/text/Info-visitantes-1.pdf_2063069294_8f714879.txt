They have a very benign climate with mild temperatures being the average in summer 
is 21.5ºC and in winter 10.8ºC.  
The city of  A Coruña  is at the same time a historic 
coastal city, of great importance already in the Roman 
times, and a modern and very cosmopolitan city of 
over 250.000 inhabitants. It is an industrial and 
service city, centre of a bigger metropolitan area. The 
symbol of the city is the well‐known lighthouse called 
“Torre de Hércules” which is the only roman 
lighthouse still functioning nowadays. It was declared 
World Heritage by UNESCO in 2009. The easiest way to get to A Coruña is by plane. By 
car, the Alvedro airport is just 15 minutes away from A Coruña and 30 minutes away 
from Ferrol, and the Santiago de Compostela airport is 50 minutes away from A Coruña 
and 60 minutes away from Ferrol.  
The city of Ferrol has more than 80.000 inhabita nts and it 
represents the neurological, commercial and industrial 
centre of one of the most densely populated areas of 
Galicia. The characteristics of its maritime location make it 
a strategic place, and that is why the campus of Ferrol 
stands out because of naval studies.
