Abstract  
 
This paper examines whether there is a political  budget cycle (PBC) in countries in the euro 
area. Using a multivariate model for 1999-2004 and various election indicators we find strong 
evidence that after the start of the Stability and Growth Pact fiscal policy makers in the euro 
area have pursued expansionary policies before el ections. In an election-year – but not in the 
year prior to the election – the budget deficit increases. This result is in line with third 
generation PBC models, which are based on moral hazard. We also find a significant but 
small partisan effect on fiscal policy outcomes.

1. Introduction 
It is often thought that incumbents try to use expansionary fiscal policy before 
elections to increase their popularity. Howeve r, most empirical studies examining the 
existence of a political budget cycle (PBC) 1 in industrial countries find little support for such 
election-driven fiscal policy manipulations. 2 Some of these studies examine whether a PBC 
exists in member countries of the Europ ean Union (EU). For example, Andrikopoulos et al. 
(2004) investigate whether incumbent government s manipulated fiscal policy in order to 
enhance re-election perspectives. Their empirical evidence for the 1970–1998 period does not 
support this hypothesis. Also De Haan and Stur m (1994), who examine  fiscal policy in the 
European Community during the 1980s, find no support for PBCs. However, other studies 
focusing on the “old” member countries of the EU claim that in more recent years fiscal 
policy often turned expansionary before el ections. For instance, Buti and van den Noord 
(2003) report electoral effects based on an examin ation of the discretionary part of fiscal 
policy over the 1999-2002 period. Also Von Hagen ( 2003) concludes that there is evidence 
for a PBC in EU member countries. For the period 1998-2002 he finds that the (unweighted) 
average fiscal impulse in pre-election years is  significantly higher than the average fiscal 
impulse in all other country-year cases.3 
The results of these last two papers are somewhat surprising since member countries 
of the EU are restricted in their fiscal polic ies by the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). The 
SGP consists of two Council Regulations: one on the strengthening of the surveillance and co-
ordination of budgetary positions, and the other on speeding up and clarifying the 
implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. A corresponding European Council 
Resolution ties them together. Regulation 1466/97 sets out to strengthen multilateral 
surveillance and gives member states a goal of  a medium term budgetary position of close to 
balance or in surplus. Regulation 1467/97 clar ifies and accelerates the excessive deficit 
procedure as specified in the Maastricht Treaty so that – in principle – within 10 months non-
interest bearing deposits and ultimately fine s can be imposed in case the member state 
concerned takes no effective actions to redress so-called excessive deficits (measured against 
reference values of 3% of GDP for the general government budget deficit and 60% for the 
general government debt-to-GDP ratio).4 According to Buti and Van den Noord (2003: 4), the 
SGP “is unquestionably the most stringent s upranational ‘commitment technology’ ever 
adopted by sovereign governments on a voluntary basis in the attempt to establish and 
maintain sound public finances. The SGP, if a pplied according to its letter and spirit, will 

 4 
have important implications for the behaviour of budgetary authorities in both the short term 
(cyclical stabilisation, policy co-ordination) and long term (sustainability of public finances).” 
This paper examines whether there really ex ists a PBC in EU member countries in the 
euro area. We focus on EU members that have adopted the euro since the rules of the SGP are 
less strict for member countries that are not pa rt of the currency union. In contrast to Buti and 
Van den Noord (2003) and Von Hagen (2003) we use a multivariate model. Furthermore, 
instead of employing election dummies – like most previous PBC studies – we use an election 
variable suggested by Franzese (2000) that takes the timing of an election in the course of a 
year into account. On the basis of data for the period 1999-2004 we find strong evidence that 
the SGP has not restricted fiscal policy makers in the euro area in pursuing expansionary 
policies before elections. In an election-year – but not in the year prior to the election – the 
budget deficit increases. This result is in line with third generation PBC models, which are 
based on moral hazard. We also find that the political composition of the government has a 
significant (but small) influence on net lending. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers some theoretical 
considerations and reviews previous empirical studies, while section 3 outlines the empirical 
model. Section 4 contains the main results and section 5 presents the outcomes of various 
sensitivity tests. The final section offers some concluding comments. 
 
 
2. Theoretical considerations and previous empirical studies5 
Three generations of theoretical PBC models  can be distinguished. The first generation 
models emphasize the incumbent’s intention to secure re-election by maximizing its expected 
vote share at the next election (Nordhaus, 1975). It is assumed that the electorate is backward 
looking and evaluates the government on the basis of its past track record. As a result, these 
models imply that governments, regardless of ideological orientation, adopt expansionary 
fiscal policies in the late year(s) of their term in office in order to stimulate the economy. 
The second generation models – Shi and Sv ensson (2004) call them adverse selection-
type models – emphasize the role of tempor ary information asymmetries regarding the 
politicians’ competence level in explaining electoral cycles in fiscal policy. In these models, 
signalling is the driving force behind the PBC. The first of these models is due to Rogoff and 
Sibert (1988), who assume that each political ca ndidate has a competence level (high or low), 
which is only known to the politician and not to the electorate. Voters want to elect the more 
competent politician and form rational expectations regarding the incumbent’s type based on 

 5 
observable current fiscal policy outcomes. Befo re the election, the high-type incumbent will 
attempt to signal his type (and thereby increas e his chances of re-election) by engaging in 
expansionary fiscal policy, which is less “costly” for him than it is for the low type. This leads 
to a pre-election increase in the government deficit when a competent politician is in office. 
Rogoff (1990) argues that the incumbent can also signal his competence before an election by 
shifting government expenditure towards easily observed consumption spending and away 
from investment. As pointed out by Shi and Sven sson (2004), some of the implications of the 
signalling models seem to be at odds with both empirical and anecdotal evidence. For 
example, only the more competent politician (rath er than the less competent one) distorts the 
economy in the separating equilibrium of th e signalling game. Likewise, only competent 
politicians will be re-elected. Furthermore, since only competent types signal by creating a 
boom before an election, the testable implicati ons are unclear without additional information 
on the (unobservable) type of the incumbent. 
These drawbacks do not apply to the third generation PBC models, which are based on 
moral hazard. Examples of such studies ar e Persson and Tabellini (2000) and Shi and 
Svensson (2002). As in the adverse selection models, each politician has some competence 
level, which is unknown to the electorate. Additionally, it is assumed that the politician 
cannot observe his competence level ex ante either. That is, politicians are uncertain about 
how well they will be able to handle future problems. Voters are rational and therefore want 
to elect the most competent politician since th at would imply higher levels of post-election 
public goods production. The constituents’ inference is based on the observable 
macroeconomic performance of the incumbent government. The key assumption is that the 
incumbent government can exert a hidden effort, that is, to use a policy instrument 
unobservable to the public, which is a substitute for competence. For example, if competence 
measures how well the politician can convert revenues into public goods, then the hidden 
effort can be interpreted as the government’s short-term excess borrowing. Elections take 
place after the incumbent government’s hidden effort and competence have jointly determined 
the observable macroeconomic outcome. The in cumbent government would like to increase 
its performance index by exerting more effo rt (borrow more), hoping that voters would 
attribute the boost in public goods provision to its  competence. In the equilibrium of this 
moral hazard game, there will be an excessive effort on the part of the incumbent politician, 
and, as a result, there is an increase in the budge t deficit prior to an election. In these models 
all types of incumbent governments will in cur excessive pre-election budget deficits 
(independent of their competence level). As Sh i and Svensson (2004) point out, one can test 

 6 
these empirical predictions no matter whether the type of the incumbent government is 
observable. Furthermore, the implications of this model can be tested for all democratic 
countries, irrespective of their political structure (e.g. the existence of partisan differences). 
Brender and Drazen (2005) argue that until recently a PBC was generally thought to 
be a phenomenon of less developed economies.  For instance, Schuknecht (1996) reports 
evidence for a PBC in his sample of 35 de veloping countries over the period 1970-92 and 
Block (2002) finds for a cross-section of 44 Sub-Saharan African countries that the 
government fiscal deficit increases by 1.2 per centage points in election years. Likewise, 
Schuknecht (2000) finds for a sample of tw enty-four developing countries for the 1973–1992 
period that incumbent governments tend to increase public investment prior to elections. 
Hallerberg et al.  (2002) consider whether political business cycles exist  in East European 
accession countries during the period 1990–9.  They find that governments of accession 
countries with a fixed exchange rate regime manipulate  their economy in election years 
through running larger budgets. 
However, some recent studies present evidence for the existence of a PBC in a large 
cross-section of both developed and developi ng countries. For instance, Shi and Svensson 
(2002) show that significant pre-electoral incr eases in the government budget deficit exist for 
their panel of 91 developing and develope d countries over the period 1975-95. Moreover, 
Persson and Tabellini (2002) report statistically si gnificant tax decreases before elections in a 
sample of 60 democracies over the period 1960-98. Brender and Drazen (2005) pose, 
however, that the results of these studies are driven by the experience of so-called “new 
democracies”, where fiscal manipulation may be effective because of lack of experience with 
electoral politics in these countries. They argue that once the “new democracies” are removed 
from the sample, the PBC disappears. Nonetheless, some recent studies focusing on 
“established democracies” find evidence for the existence of a PBC.  For instance, Alt and 
Lassen (2005) argue that among advanced demo cracies significant opportunistic electoral 
cycles are conditional on the transparency of  budget institutions. In countries with less 
transparent institutions the electoral cycle in fiscal policy appears, while no such election-
related fiscal policy movements show up in higher-transparency countries. However, Tujula 
and Wolswijk (2004) find support for a PBC inde pendently of fiscal institutions in their 
sample of OECD countries for the peri od 1970-2002. Likewise, Buti and Van den Noord 
(2003) and Von Hagen (2003) claim that fis cal policy in EU member countries turns 
expansionary before elections despite the introduction of the SGP. In the next sections we will 
examine whether there are indeed political budget cycles in the euro area.

3. Empirical model and data  
In the PBC literature several indicators of fi scal policy have been suggested. The three 
measures most often used are net lending, cyc lically adjusted net lending, and the primary 
budget balance. As part of the sensitivity analysis presented below we have employed all 
measures, but in reporting our main findings we primarily focus on net lending. The cyclically 
adjusted budget balance suffers from the fact that there is no consensus on how it should be 
computed; figures provided by various intern ational organisations often show large 
differences. Furthermore, De Haan et al. (2004) demonstrate that OECD figures on cyclically 
adjusted balances are subject to large revi sions for a rather long time after their initial 
publication. As we focus on a very recent time period we therefore prefer using unadjusted 
figures. The primary balance has the advantage that it excludes interest payments, which are 
not controlled by the government. However, a lthough interest payments are more or less 
exogenous, policy makers can cut other expenditure s if interest payments go up; reluctance to 
do so during an election year should certainly be considered relevant from a PBC perspective.  
Some indicative evidence for the existence of a PBC in the euro area is shown in Table 
1, which presents an overview of the budget bala nces for all countries in the currency union 
for the period 1999 – 2004. Figures for the 20 election years are printed in bold. 
 
[insert Table 1 here] 
 
It immediately becomes clear from Table 1 that all countries, with the exception of Portugal, 
had on average lower budget balances during el ection years than during years without a 
parliamentary election. The (unweighted) average budget balance for all election years in the 
sample equals –1.4%, while for election years it is –.5%. The t-statistic for the difference 
between the two values equals 1.42, which is signi ficant at the 10% level. However, in order 
to draw more compelling conclusions regardi ng PBCs in the euro area a model is required 
that takes into account other potentially relevant determinants of the budget balance. 
Apart from electoral influences, our empiri cal model accounts for two factors that are 
not directly controlled by policy makers but aff ect fiscal policy outcomes. First, to filter 
automatic stabilisation effects from our fiscal policy measure we include the output gap as a 
proxy for the business cycle. An economic ups wing will lead to an increase in the budget 
balance, while in the downward phase of the bus iness cycle the balance usually deteriorates. 
As there is no consensus in the literature how to construct the output gap, we use output gaps 

 8 
based on potential GDP as well as on tre nd GDP both calculated by the European 
Commission. 
Second, since unforeseen economic developmen ts may affect fiscal policy outcomes 
we include the difference between actual and expected real GDP growth. The expected 
growth rates are the GDP growth forecasts as available at the time the government budget was 
decided upon. A higher than expected growth ra te will lead to an increase in the budget 
balance due to, amongst others, unexpected incr eases in tax receipts. Likewise, unexpected 
inflation may have an effect on the budget bala nce. As pointed out by Tujula and Wolswijk 
(2004), inflation may affect government receipts and expenditures through nominal 
progression in tax rates and tax brackets, and via price-indexation of receipts and 
expenditures. On the other hand, unexpected in flation erodes the real value of nominal 
government debt so that the overall effect  of inflation on the budget balance is not  clear a 
priori. 
After accounting for the effects of business cycle fluctuations and forecasting errors in 
GDP growth and inflation, all remaining change s in the budget balance are considered to be 
the result of discretionary fiscal policy. These considerations suggest estimating the following 
equation: 
 
() () ()
ff
it 0 1 it it 2 it it 3 it 4 itBB = β +β y- y βπ - π +β GAP + β ( ) + εElection Measure∆+ ∆  (1) 
 
where itBB∆  is the change in the overall budget bala nce as measured by the change in net 
lending; f
it ity - y  stands for the difference between actua l real GDP growth at time t and real 
growth as forecasted at the time fiscal policy for year t was determined; f
it itπ - π  represents the 
difference between actual inflation at time t a nd inflation as forecasted at the time fiscal 
policy for year t was determined; itGAP∆  measures the change in the output gap in year t as a 
percentage of GDP.  
 
In order to take account of potential election effects, two alternative indicators are considered. 
The first involves adding a dummy to the equa tion which indicates whether a year is an 
election year or not ( Election year
itD ). A similar dummy will be used to account for pre-election 
years. As fiscal policy decisions may take some time to have an effect, election-induced fiscal 
measures could be taken in the year prior to the actual election.  

 9 
The second indicator takes the timing of an election in the course of the year into 
account. It has been developed by Franzese (2000) and is calculated as: 
 
()itELE = M 1 + d/D /12−        ( 2 )  
 
where M is the month of the election, d is the da y of the election and D is the number of days 
in that month. For the year prior to the election year the indicator is calculated as: 
 
()itELE = 12 M 1 d/D /12−− −       ( 3 )  
 
In all other years its value is set to zero. For r easons that will become clear later, we want to 
be able to interpret the values of the election indicator in terms of actual election dates. This 
means that an indicator value of, for instance, 7/12 in an election year as well as a value of 
5/12 in a pre-election year imply that elections take place at the end of July. In general, this 
requires that snap elections are ignored b ecause the length of the period during which 
election-driven policy manipulations can occur, that  is, the period between a government 
crisis and the early election, does not say anythi ng at all about the actual election date since it 
usually does not amount to exactly 365 days. As a result of these considerations, 19 
observations for election years and 12 observati ons for pre-election years can be used in 
calculating the election indicator.  
The macroeconomic data necessary to estimate the model have been obtained from 
stability programmes of the EU countries a nd official publications of the European 
Commission. Data on general election dates are mainly taken from political data yearbooks 
(Katz and Koole (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003) and Van Biezen  and Katz (2004)). The 
sample contains observations for all twelve countries in the euro area – Austria, Belgium, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and 
Spain – over the time period 1999 to 2004. The appe ndix contains a detailed overview of the 
data sources used. 
 
IV. Results 
Columns I and II of Table 2 present benchmar k regressions that contain only the economic 
control variables. The difference between the re gressions is the output gap variable used; in 
column I this variable is constructed on the ba sis of potential output, while in column II it is 
calculated on the basis of trend income. It follows  that only the coefficients for the output gap 
measures are significantly different from zero. For each regressor, including the constant, an 

 10 
F-test was performed to test whether common coefficients could be assumed over all cross-
sections in the sample. In all cases, the test failed to reject the null hypothesis of poolability. 
 
[insert Table 2 here] 
 
In columns III and IV a pre-election year dummy is added to the model. In both 
specifications the election coefficients have a negative sign but are not very significant. 
Moreover, the fit of the mode l does not improve substantially compared to the benchmark 
regressions. However, this changes when th e pre-election year dummy is replaced by an 
election year dummy (columns V and VI). Now the adjusted R-squared rises to about 0.46 
and the election effect is highly significant. Also an unexpected increase in GDP growth has a 
positive and significant effect on the budget balan ce. However, the coefficient of unexpected 
inflation remains insignificant. Finally, columns VII and VIII of Table 2 present 
specifications in which pre-election as well as  election year dummies are included. The pre-
election year dummy becomes somewhat more significant than before, but the fit of the model 
decreases slightly compared to the specifica tion in which only an election year dummy is 
taken into account. 
 Table 3 presents the results that are obtained when possible election effects are 
modelled more accurately, that is, by means of the election indicator as suggested by Franzese 
(2000). In columns I and II an indicator is a dded, labelled with the superscript ‘standard’, 
which comprises both pre-election and election y ears. The coefficients of the output gap and 
unexpected GDP growth are significantly diffe rent from zero. There is also a highly 
significant election effect. If the election variable  is decomposed into separate effects for pre-
election and election years, the same pattern as  in Table 2 becomes visible. Columns III and 
IV of Table 3 show that there is no effect in the pre-election year, while columns V and VI 
indicate the existence of a highly significant effect during the election year. This is underlined 
by the high adjusted R-squared. Columns VII and VIII of Table 3 show that including the two 
indicators simultaneously does not lead to a significant effect during pre-election years.  
Hence, our results suggest that only during the election year the budget deficit 
increases. This increase amounts to .96% of GDP  according to the model with the election 
year dummy and .83% of GDP according to th e model with the election-year indicator. 6 The 
latter figure is obtained trough multiplication of th e coefficient estimate for the election year 
indicator obtained in column VI  of Table 3, with the average value of the indicator over all 
election years (which is .38 in our sample). 

 11 
 
[insert Table 3 here] 
 
At first sight it seems rather peculiar that there exists such a large difference between 
the effects of pre-election and election years. Th is is especially surprising since the average 
value for all pre-election year indicators in the sample equals .65, indicating that in general a 
large fraction of the 365-day period prior to el ections in our sample was part of the pre-
election year. However, there is a plausible explanation for this phenomenon that can be 
derived from the third generation PBC models as  outlined in section 2. In these models, it is 
assumed that the government uses short-term ex cess borrowing as a hidden effort – that is, as 
a policy instrument unobservable to the electorate – in order to increase its performance 
index. Borrowing extra money during a pre-election year is less easy to hide in comparison to 
borrowing during an election year since inform ation on the pre-election year’s budget deficit 
is likely to be published prior to the election da te. As a result, the policy instrument is not 
unobservable anymore since all excess government borrowing will be noticed by the 
electorate. Consequently, the increase in the government’s performance index will not take 
place. In fact, the index might even declin e if the electorate strongly prefers budgetary 
discipline.7 
 The mechanism described above also implie s that the relationship between the timing 
of an election during the year and electoral -induced fiscal policy manipulations is non-
monotonic. There is a trade-off between two e ffects: a higher value of the election-year 
measure indicates that during that year there is ample time for the government to increase its 
performance index, but a higher value of the election-year variable also indicates that it will 
be more difficult for the government to adequately hide its efforts from the electorate since 
more reliable statistics on the size of the budget balance are available to the public. 
 To test this further, we transform the election-year indicator into two dummy 
variables. The first dummy ( Election in Q1/Q4
itD ) is given a value of 1 if an election took place 
during the first or last quarter of the year, in all other cases its value is set to zero. The second 
dummy variable is constructed in the same wa y, but indicates whether an election took place 
during the 2 nd or 3 rd quarter. If the hypothesised trade-off indeed exists, the election effect 
should be the strongest for observations cove red by the second dummy variable. Columns I 
and II of Table 4 present the resu lts. Clearly, both models fit the data substantially better than 
the models estimated before, and the coeffici ent estimates for both dummy variables suggest 

 12 
that the relationship between the change in net lending and the value of the election year 
indicator is non-linear. This is further suppor ted by the results from columns III and IV, 
which account for a non-linear election effect by using a squared election-year indicator in 
addition to the original one. The model fit is quite good, and the coefficients for the election 
year variables are highly significant. 8 The pattern that can be derived from the coefficient 
estimates for the election effect (based on column  III of Table 4) is de picted in Figure 1. The 
graph shows that fiscal policy becomes more expa nsionary when the election date is closer to 
the middle of the year.

5. Sensitivity analysis 
In order to test the robustness of our results with respect to sample composition, we estimated 
equations III and IV of Table 4 twelve times, each time excluding one country from the 
sample. Although the exclusion of France results in an insignificant coefficient for the 
unexpected growth variable9, the election effect is always highly significant (results available 
on request).  
In addition, we have estimated specifications  III and IV using as dependent variable 
alternative indicators of fiscal policy that have  been suggested in the literature. First, while 
excluding the output gap as regressor, we used  cyclically adjusted changes in net lending. 
Second, we employed the level of net lending wh ile adopting the output gap level instead of 
the change therein as a regressor, and third, we used changes in the primary balance. In all 
cases, the outcomes were highly comparable to the ones originally obtained, the election-year 
effect being slightly weaker in the first case, somewhat stronger in the second, and virtually 
unchanged in the third (results are available on request).   
Next, we have examined whether our findi ngs are influenced by the inclusion of 
variables reflecting political-institutional conditions that have been suggested to affect fiscal 
policy. Therefore, in specification III of Table 4 we included variables reflecting i) the type of 
government, ii) the fractionalisation of government, and iii) the positioning of the government 
on a left-right scale.10 

 13 
Since Roubini and Sachs (1989), various studies have examined the impact of the type 
of government on fiscal policy outcomes. The basic idea is that coalition governments are 
weaker than single-party majoritarian governments and therefore will end up with higher 
deficits if the country concerned is hit by a negative economic shock. Roubini and Sachs 
(1989) present evidence in support of this view , but other studies reject the hypothesis (see, 
for example, De Haan and Sturm, 1997). To ta ke the type of government into account, we 
construct a dummy, which is one in case of a single-party government and zero in all other 
cases. It turned out that the dummy’s coeffici ent was positive but highly insignificant with a 
p-value of .54. The other results remained unchanged. 
Perotti and Kontopoulos (2002) argue that the fractionalisation of government – 
measured by the number of political parties or the number of spending ministers in 
government – affects fiscal policy. The more fragmented the government, i.e. the higher the 
number of parties or spending ministers, the higher will be the budget deficit. There is quite 
some support for this view (see, for instance, Volkerink and De Haan, 2001). Therefore, the 
number of political parties in government as well as the number of spending ministers in 
government were separately included in th e regressions. They both failed to reach 
significance (p-values of .18 and .91, respectively) and did not affect the election effect. 
As Franzese (2000) puts it, at least sin ce Hibbs (1977) political economists have 
argued that parties of the right and left differ in  their fiscal policy priorities. Specifically, left-
wing governments favour larger public economies, greater redistribution, and more Keynesian 
expansion and so are expected to run greater  deficits than right-wing governments. Since 
several empirical studies indeed suggest that the political colour of a government affects fiscal 
policy outcomes (see Franzese (2002) for a discussion), the influence of the government’s 
positioning on a left-right scale was also taken into account. This was done by constructing 
the variable GCOL, which uses a scaling from 1 for ultra-left to 20 for ultra-right 
governments. Data on party colour were obtained from Benoit and Laver (2005). The 
estimation results are presented in columns V and VI of Table 4. The political composition of 
the government indeed has a significant influence on the change in net lending. However, this 
influence is rather small. Again, adding this  variable does not substantially affect the 
coefficient of our election variables. 
Finally, some specific non-political variables were added to the model as a further 
robustness test. A number of previous studies ha ve suggested that there may be asymmetries 
in fiscal responses to recessions and upturns. For instance, Mayes and Viren (2000) argue that 
during recessions governments pursue expansionary  fiscal policies to combat the downturn, 

 14 
while during economic upswings the proceeds are used for cutting taxes or increasing 
spending rather than for additional consolidation. Therefore, a dummy is constructed that is 
one in case of a positive change in the output gap and zero otherwise. As it is highly 
insignificant, with a p-value of .77, there is no reason to assume fiscal policy responds 
differently in magnitude to positive changes in the output gap than to negative changes. 
Including the variable did not affect our other results. 
Also the debt-to-GDP ratio was added to the model as it may capture concerns on the 
sustainability of fiscal policy (Tujula and Wols wijk, 2004). From a sustainability perspective, 
increasing debt ratios should lead to an impr ovement in the budget balance. In fact, Melitz 
(2000) suggests the use of a quadratic formulation for the debt ratio as higher debt levels may 
induce more stabilizing fiscal reactions. However, a higher debt ratio also causes a rise in 
interest payments, resulting in a worsening fiscal balance. As a consequence, the overall 
effect of the debt ratio on budget balances is not a priori clear. Indeed, the coefficients of the 
level and the squared level of the debt-to-GDP ratio are insignificant with p-values between 
.15 and .22. Again, the election effect remains unchanged. 
 
 
6. Conclusions  
As Buti and Van den Noord ( 2003) point out, in the run-up to the monetary union the 
incentives for national policy makers to stick to  the announced consolidation path were quite 
strong since failure of meeting the convergence cr iteria carried the penalty of exclusion from 
the euro area. This was considered too hard  a political sanction. However, things may be 
different once a country has been admitted to the monetary union. That is, unlike the 
Maastricht convergence criteria, sticking to the rules of the SGP may not pay politically. This 
holds true especially for large countries (see De Haan et al., 2004). Moreover, the adoption of 
fiscal consolidation policies during the run- up to the monetary union might have actually 
created the room of manoeuvre for politically motivated fiscal actions. 
This paper examines whether there is a PBC in EU member countries in the euro area 
despite the adoption of the Stability and Growth  Pact. We concentrate on EU members that 
have adopted the euro since the rules of the SG P are less strict for member countries that are 
not part of the currency union. We use a more s ophisticated approach than previous studies 
that focused on the recent fiscal policy experi ence of EU member countries. Using data for 
the period 1999-2004 we find strong evidence that the SGP did not withhold policy makers 
from pursuing expansionary fiscal policies before elections. In an election year – but not in 

 15 
the year prior to the election – the budget defic it increases. This result is in line with third 
generation PBC models, which are based on moral hazard. We also conclude that fiscal policy 
is somewhat more expansionary under left-wing policy makers. 
Finally, two important caveats are in order. First, since the currency union started only 
six years ago, our analysis is based on a short sample period. Nonetheless, given the relatively 
large number of elections in the period 1999-2004 – all countries had general elections as part 
of the regular electoral cycle – our evidence cl early indicates the existence of electorally 
motivated fiscal policies. Second, our anal ysis is based on aggregate measures of 
discretionary fiscal policy and may therefore not fully capture PBCs. Governments may lower 
taxes or give extra subsidies to special intere st groups in order to maximize the probability of 
being re-elected and such changes may not s how up in aggregated data. A suggestion for 
future research is therefore to use more di saggregated measures of discretionary fiscal 
policies. 
 
Notes 
 
1 A political budget cycle is a periodic fluctuation in a government’s fiscal policies, which is 
induced by the cyclicality of elections. Sh i and Svensson (2004) review some recent 
developments in the theory and evidence of  these cycles. See also Franzese (2002) and 
Drazen (2001) for extensive reviews of the literature. 
2 There are exceptions, however. For instance, Alesina et al . (1997), who perform cross-
section time series regressions on a panel of  13 OECD countries for the period between 1961 
and 1993, find that the government budget deficit is 0.6 percent of GDP higher in election 
years. Also Franzese (2000) reports evidence for electoral manipulation of fiscal policy in his 
sample of 20 OECD countries. 
3 However, the evidence of Von Hagen is not very convincing. For instance, he takes both 
presidential and parliamentary elections into account even though presidents in some 
countries have hardly any influence on policy-making. De Haan et al.  (2003) could not 
replicate his findings. 
4 See Amtenbrink and De Haan (2003) for an extensive discussion of the SGP. De Haan et al. 
(2004) examine the weaknesses of the SGP. See also Schuknecht (2004). 
5 The first part of this section heavily draws on Andrikopoulos et al.  (2004) and Shi and 
Svensson (2004). See Lohmann (1998) for an analysis of monetary policy. 

 16 
6 This conclusion is not affected by the exclusion of snap elections in calculating the election 
indicators (results available on request).   
7 There is some evidence (see, for instance, Brender 2003) suggesting that a deterioration of 
the financial position of the government harm s the chances of re-election faced by the 
incumbent. Brender (2003) argues that this should be the case in all “well developed 
democracies” where voters can monitor the evolution of public finances. Drazen and Eslava 
(2003) try to reconcile this fiscal conservativeness and the PBC. 
8 A caveat is in order here since the sample contains only three observations for which the 
election year indicator has a value greater th an 0.5. However, the squared election indicator 
only becomes insignificant when all three thes e observations are removed, making it unlikely 
that it is based on an outlier. Hence, even though all other results also suggest a non-linear 
election effect, further research into the non-lin ear effect is warranted once more data is 
available. 
9 This could be the result of collinearity between forecasting errors in growth rates and 
changes in the output gap since the correlati on between both variables equals 0.75. However, 
this does not affect our main conclusions si nce both regressors are only used as control 
variables meant to pick up influences other th an discretionary fiscal policy decisions on the 
budget balance. 
10 We did not include an indicator of budgetary institutions as figures for all countries over 
our estimation period are not available. See, for instance, Hallerberg (2004) for a discussion.

Appendix: Data sources  
(Cyclically adjusted) net lending and primary budget balance. Statistics on general 
government net lending and cyclically adjusted net lending were obtained from the Statistical 
Annex to European Economy, published in spring 2005. Statistics for 1998, which were 
necessary to calculate the change in net lending for 1999, were obtained from Eurostat. 
Statistics on the primary budget balance were also obtained from Eurostat. 
 
Forecasting errors in GDP growth rates and inflation.  Statistics regarding outcomes of GDP 
growth and GDP deflators were obtained from  the Statistical Annex to European Economy, 
published in spring 2005. Forecasts on these vari ables were obtained from the countries’ 
stability programmes as published one year in advance. In order to ensure that time intervals 
between forecast and realisation dates are comparable across the sample, forecasts from 
stability programmes published after January of the year under consideration were not used. 
They were substituted by European Commission Autumn Forecasts presented in issues of 
European Economy that were published during the year preceding the year under 
consideration. This way, 7 out of 72 observations were replaced.  
 
Output gap. Statistics regarding output gaps based on trend and potential GDP were obtained 
from the Statistical Annex to European Economy, published in spring 2005. 
 
General election dates and cabinet crises. Statistics for 1998 to 2003 are obtained from 
political data yearbooks (Katz and Kool e (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003) and Van Biezen  
and Katz (2004)). Election data for 2004 were obt ained from the online version of the Europa 
Yearbook (http://www.europaworld.com). 
 
Type of government and government fractionalisation. Statistics on the number of parties and 
ministers in the government were obtained from  the same sources used to obtain data on 
election dates and cabinet crises. In case a ch ange of government occurred during the year, 
averages were taken using the percentage of  the year during which each government was in 
power. In calculating the number of parties, i ndependent cabinet members were excluded. In 
calculating the number of ministers, finance ministers or ministers for the budget were 
excluded. Junior ministers, secretaries of state and ministers to the prime minister were not 
taken into account either. 
 

 21 
Government positioning on a left-right scale. Data on party colour were obtained from Benoit 
and Laver (2005). However, for France data from the Comparative Manifestos Project (Budge 
et al., 2001) was used, which did not affect the re sults. In fact, using only the CMP data in 
constructing the variable leads to identical conclusions. 
 
Debt to GDP ratio. Statistics on debt ratios were obtai ned from the Statistical Annex to 
European Economy, published in spring 2005.
