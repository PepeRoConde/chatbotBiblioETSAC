Tutorial Action Plan
One of the strength within the current context of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) are the Tutorial Action Plans (TAP) .The Faculty of Nursing and Podiatry has this program, wich counts on the participation of the teachers of the center in the search to promote the training of the students, to favor the academic excellence, to provide a comprehensive training, to pay attention to all the students and to respond to the new needs of the EHEA.
The Faculty TAP is a service that students can use as an option, but it is recommended for everyone, since it can facilitate their passage through the university taking advantage of all the possibilities it offers.
For any questions or for more information you can contact with the TAP coordinator in the Faculty of Nursing and Podiatry: Francisco Alonso Tajes
