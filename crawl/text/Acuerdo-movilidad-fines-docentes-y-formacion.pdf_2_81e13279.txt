 II. COMMITMENT OF THE THREE PARTIES By signingxviii this document, the teaching staff member, the sending institution/enterprise and the receiving institution confirm that they approve the proposed mobility agreement. The sending higher education institution supports the staff mobility as part of its modernisation and internationalisation strategy and will recognise it as a component in any evaluation or assessment of the teaching staff member. The teaching staff member will share his/her experience, in particular its impact on his/her professional development and on the sending higher education institution, as a source of inspiration to others.  The teaching staff member and the beneficiary institution commit to the requirements set out in the grant agreement signed between them. The teaching staff member and the receiving institution will communicate to the sending institution/enterprise any problems or changes regarding the proposed mobility programme or mobility period.  The teacher Name: Signature:  Date:   The sending institution/enterprise Name of the responsible person: Bruno Casal Rodríguez – Head IRO Signature:   Date:    The receiving institution Name of the responsible person: Signature:   Date:    x In case the mobility combines teaching and training activities, this template should be used and adjusted to fit both activity types xi Seniority:  Junior (approx. < 10 years of experience), Intermediate (approx. > 10 and < 20 years of experience) or Senior (approx. > 20 years of experience). xii Nationality: Country to which the person belongs administratively and that issues the ID card and/or passport. xiii All refererences to "enterprise" are only applicable to mobility for staff between Programme Countries or within Capacity Building projects. xiv Erasmus Code: A unique identifier that every higher education institution that has been awarded with the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education receives. It is only applicable to higher education institutions located in Programme Countries. xv Country code: ISO 3166-2 country codes available at: https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. xvi The ISCED-F 2013 search tool (available at http://ec.europa.eu/education/tools/isced-f_en.htm) should be used to find the ISCED 2013 detailed field of education and training. xvii A minimum of 8 teaching hours per week (or any shorter period of stay) has to be respected. If the mobility lasts longer than one week, the minimum number of teaching hours for an incomplete week shall be proportional to the duration of that week. If the teaching activity is combined with a training activity during a single period abroad, the minimum is reduced to 4 teaching hours per week (or any shorter period of stay). There is no minimum number of teaching hours for invited staff from enterprises. xviii Circulating papers with original signatures is not compulsory. Scanned copies of signatures or electronic signatures may be accepted, depending on the national legislation of the country of the sending institution (in the case of mobility with Partner Countries: the national legislation of the Programme Country). Certificates of attendance can be provided electronically or through any other means accessible to the staff member and the sending institution.
