Some brief information and differences between NIE and TIE 
NIE: 
• Número de identificación de extranjero (foreign citizen identification number) 
• For non-UE nationalities, it is issued directly by the Ministry in the resolution of 
the residence and work authorization. 
• It must be applied for by those EU citizens legally living and working in Spain 
through a Police Station. It is necessary to pay a fee. 
• In the case of refugees, the procedure differs (please contact!). 
TIE: 
• Tarjeta de identificación de extranjero (foreign citizen identification card). 
• You have to apply for it AFTER having the NIE issued. 
• You have to pay a fee and get a physical appointment at the designated Police 
Stations where your fingerprints will be registered. 
• The TIE is not issued at the moment. It takes around one month to have it, and 
you will collect it from the Police Station where you previously attended. 
• In the case of refugees the procedure differs (please contact!). 
At the UDC Euraxess Contact Point we can help you and your direct family members (1st 
degree) through the process.
