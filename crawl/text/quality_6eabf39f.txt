Quality Assurance
The FIC has an Internal Quality Guarantee System (Sistema de Garantía Interna de Calidade, SGIC) whose main purpose is to guarantee the quality of the centre, and particularly that of the studies it is responsible for. Our SGIC was designed according to the directives of the Programa FIDES-AUDIT of the Axencia para a Calidade do Sistema Universitario de Galicia (ACSUG) and it is operative since the course 2010/11. The implementation of our SGIC according to the directives of the aforementioned program was certified by ACSUG on 31/07/2013, our centre being one of the very first ones at national level in achieving this certification.
