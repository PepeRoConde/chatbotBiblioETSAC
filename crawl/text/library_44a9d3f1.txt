Welcome to the website of the Intercentre Library of the Faculty of Sociology and the Faculty of Communication Sciences.
Our aim is to offer a public service of quality that serves as support for the learning and the teaching and research work of the University . To do this we offer our users a specialized collection, we organise training courses, we manage access to electronic resources and collaborate in projects whose purpose is to make visible the scientific work of our researchers and students.
The most important asset of this library is its staff that contribute, as long as they can, to make UDC an open university integrated in the society that surrounds it. So, we work with projects that are committed to training people with disabilities, we organize exhibitions, manage the presence of the library on social networks or participate in programs so prospective students know university before enrolling.
To communicate with the library can do so through by:
