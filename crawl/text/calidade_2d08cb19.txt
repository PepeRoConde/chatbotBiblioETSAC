Guidelines of Quality Policy
The Management of the SCHOOL OF NAUTICAL STUDIES AND MARINE ENGINEERING (SNSME) of A Corunna, considers the quality as a fundamental strategic factor to achieve that his and her graduated are perceived by the Shipowners, by the employers in general and by the organisms interested at the national and international level as fully competent and apt to execute the duties and responsibilities that his respective title confers them.
The Management of the SNSME of A Corunna directs all his efforts to achieve the satisfaction of the needs and reasonable expectations, of all his customers, including the strict fulfilment of the applicable legal requirements (national or international laws or agreements), employing all his technical resources, economic and humans, conceding particular importance to the training, evaluation of the competences and update of the knowledge of his personnel at all levels, as well as to the maintenance of the technological level of his equipment.
The Management of the SNSME of A Corunna is conscious that the implantation of a Quality Management System, based, in our case, in the PROGRAM FIDES-AUDIT, is contemplated in the international rules of compulsory compliance, such as the The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers 1978 as amended in 1995 and 2010 (STCW 2010), the Spanish legislation that develops it, and Directive (EU) 2022/993 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers, in reply to the eminently international nature that has the exercise of such professions.
The Management of the SNSME of A Corunna, by means of an appropriate plan of motivation and cooperation of his staff at all levels, will ensure that this political is understood and accepted. Likewise, it will verify that the Quality Management System implanted is kept effective by means of internal audits and by a periodic review. For this reason, the Management will approve an annual plan to define the main objectives related to quality with the aim of developing a culture of continuous improvement along the years.
