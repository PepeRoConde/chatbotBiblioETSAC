2. Strengths and weaknesses of the current practice 
 
Please review the strengths and weaknesses under the four thematic areas of the Charter and Code, as provided by your organisation  in the 
initial assessment phase. When doing so, you should do not only look back, but also consider new priorities, strategic decisions, etc. which may 
further influence the action plan. Please also provide a brief commentary  in the "Remarks" column if major changes have occurred versus the 
initial plan. 
Ethical and professional aspects:  
Strengths and Weaknesses: 
Strengths: 
The University is deeply involved in providing the research staff with the necessary tools to facilitate ethical research work. In addition, the university has a gender 
equality office and a unit for attention to diversity that actively works to detect and resolve possible obstacles to professional careers for reasons of gender, age, 
disability, ethnic or religious minority, etc. 
Weaknesses: 
According to the results obtained from the survey to the research community (*please find more detailed information about the survey in the chart below) the UDC 
Research Code of Ethics continues to be generally unknown by the research community, which is a handicap for the university since the workgroup in charge of it 
made a great effort to develop and disseminate it, but its use and knowledge have not widely reached its target. 
The same happens with the Good Practice Research Manual, elaborated by the same group, also posted on the HRS4R website since 2019 and disseminated 
through the research community but still quite unknown. 
Both documents will be reviewed and updated during the next period 2022-2025 (please see action 26). 
 
Remarks (max 500 words) 
In March 2022 a survey was sent to all research staff, research assistants and technical and management staff related to research. It was necessary as since 2016 
(previous to gap analysis) no survey was massively sent to all staff involved in research activities. 
 
The survey was created by the HRS4R implementation manager through the Microsoft tool “Forms”. It was available in English, Spanish and Galician language. It was 
sent by email along with a brief explanation of the HRS4R and some basic instructions to fill in it (also in the same 3 languages). 
This questionnaire included 14 questions directly related to the given name to the actions gathered in the Action Plan stated in 2017. In each item, participants must 
choose a score on a Likert scale according to their level of knowledge about that specific action and how the University is working on it and the level of 
importance/relevance for them. 
The survey was available on the HRS4R dedicated page on the UDC website and was also directly emailed to all research community members on March 9th. A 
reminder was sent on the 19th of April and the deadline for replies was the 22nd of April.  
 
The total number of recipients of the survey was 2004, and the total of replies received was 192. The survey was anonymous but collected a few data concerning age 
range, professional category and gender.

Recruitment and selection:  
Strengths and Weaknesses: 
 
Strengths: 
 
The University is strongly committed to improving the working conditions of research personnel and for this reason has drawn up the new regulations for the selection 
and hiring of personnel charged to projects, following the recommendations of the European Commission regarding selection processes that observe the principles of 
openness, transparency and based on merit (OTM-R). 
 
This aspect was highly valued in the survey of research staff and that is why, given its importance, the University implements monitoring tools for compliance with this 
new regulation as well as providing tools to the people involved in these processes so that they can carry them out in the best possible way. For this reason, a visual 
guide has been designed to publish offers in EURAXESS, specific training is being designed for personnel with tasks related to the selection and hiring of research 
staff, and information sessions are being held and will continue to be held on the importance of how to proceed when recruiting staff. 
 
Weaknesses: 
 
Due to some inconveniences that occurred both within the University and at the national/international level, the elaboration, publication and implementation of the 
current OTM-R Policy were delayed. Therefore, at this time we have little data regarding the success in the application of this new regulation for the selection and hiring 
of personnel related to research and contracted under projects. 
 
However, this does not mean that before approving this regulation, the principles of openness, transparency and merit-based recruitment were not being followed, but 
rather that the regulation was outdated and it was necessary to have a legislative framework for the actions that were already being carried out by the University. 
 
 
Remarks (max 500 words) 
The implementation of this new regulation is still in its firsts steps, as it had to be postponed due to strong modifications in the National Labour Regulation and Science 
Law at the national level that directly affected the way Universities recruit and hire research staff. Elaboration of a new regulation for recruiting and hiring research staff 
will make all these processes more open, clear and transparent for candidates and recruiters. 
 
 
 
Working conditions:  

HRS4R Form | EURAXESS 
5/16 
 
 
Strengths and Weaknesses: 
Strengths:  
The University of A Coruña is very young and dynamic, so its research centres and specialization campuses are also very young, which means that both the 
equipment and the available infrastructures are new, with the acquisition of new materials being a constant which has a positive impact on the daily work of the 
research staff. 
In terms of salary competitiveness, the UDC is one of the Spanish institutions that offer the highest remuneration to research staff, with some of its programs to attract 
talent, such as the Intalent Program, which offers a salary well above the sector average, in addition, to take advantage of regional programs such as Oportunius of the 
Xunta de Galicia, which offers high remuneration to its participants. 
The UDC offers a salary supplement to the beneficiaries of the Ramon y Cajal grants, awarded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation to researchers of the 
highest international excellence. 
The University offers the possibility of stabilization to the beneficiaries of European grants from the ERC, Beatriz Galindo  and Ramón y Cajal grants. 
In addition, the researchers have at their disposal various specialized services that may be useful to them, such as the Research Results Transfer Office, which has a 
staff of 17 highly qualified professionals in the field of advice on fundraising and drafting of proposals, management of national and European projects, innovation 
service and creation of spin-off as well as technical support in the processing of patents and protection of intellectual property. 
 
Weaknesses: 
All aspects related to working conditions are of the utmost importance for the research staff as they were appointed in the survey (*please find more detailed 
information about the survey in the chart below), but the measures taken by the University to guarantee these optimal conditions are still largely unknown. Therefore, it 
is necessary to give a strong boost to the dissemination actions of the new measures approved by the University's Governing Board. 
It is necessary to publicise more about the living and working conditions offered by the University of A Coruña (work-family balance, flexibility, the possibility of 
telecommuting, competitive salary and top-quality equipment and infrastructure, among others) in order to attract more national and international talent.

Due to the new National Labour Regulation approved by the Spanish Government, last 31st December 2021 and some modifications recently made to the National 
Science Law, some working conditions for the University staff have improved, mainly those related to the type of contract being, from then on, most of them 
permanent. 
In March 2022 a survey was sent to all research staff, research assistants and technical and management staff related to research. It was necessary as since 2016 
(previous to gap analysis) no survey was massively sent to all staff involved in research activities.

choose a score on a Likert scale according to their level of knowledge about that specific action and how the University is working on it and the level of 
importance/relevance for them.

Training and development:  
Strengths and Weaknesses: 
Strengths: 
The HRS4R working group produced 2 guides related to professional development: 
- Professional careers at the University of A Coruña. 
- Alternative professional careers. 
Both were elaborated, approved and published on the HRS4R website before the interim assessment of 2019. 
Some new ideas to carry out during the next period are: 
- Design of a new training plan on soft skills for researchers and other staff related to research in collaboration with the International Doctorate School. 
- New training course for staff involved in recruiting tasks. This course will be available for all UDC staff that may be interested and it will be updated when 
needed. 
*The content of these new training courses is being designed in collaboration with the Gender Equality Office to include a gender perspective 
Weaknesses: 
 Due to some unexpected circumstances these training actions have not been delivered yet, as was our wish, but are already planned as new actions in the Action 
Plan 2022-2025 (Actions 18 and 20). According to the results of the survey, training and development actions were valued as a priority by the research community 
(*please find more detailed information about the survey in the chart below).

Have any of the priorities for the short and medium-term changed? (max 500 words)  
 
The UDC is specially focused on guaranteeing the stability of the research staff. New regulation for contracting has recently been approved and implemented where 
one of the main changes is the prioritization of permanent contracts. 
We are also interested in attracting the best research talent, broadening our scope to international markets, and trying to offer attractive conditions to the best 
international researchers. Being a holder of the HR Excellence in Research Award is something that strengthens our position among other research centres and 
institutions to achieve this objective. 
Another is the current focus on gender perspective. Adding this perspective to all recruitment processes is a must and a specific training course is carefully being 
designed by the Gender Balance Office and the HRS4R working group to provide professionals involved in recruiting activities with resources and specific information 
regarding this important issue. Meanwhile, a Guidelines document on recruiting research staff under gender perspective will be shortly available on the HRS4R 
dedicated page and it will be disseminated among the research community. 
After analysing the results from the survey sent in March 2022 to the research community, we have realised the R1 group is not much aware of HRS4R and HR policy 
in general, so it is mandatory to focus on this target for the next coming period. 
 
 
Have any of the circumstances in which your organization operates changed and as such have had an impact on your HR strategy? (max 500 words) 
 
Due to major changes in the Labour Regulation approved by the Spanish Government and also some modifications to  the Science Law directly affecting the 
hiring of research staff, some decisions and documents ready to be implemented in the UDC have suffered an important delay.  
To face this, a dedicated working group was constituted and worked very hard in reformulating the UDC recruiting and hiring policy and regulations to align 
with both Spanish Government Law and European Commission recommendations.  
The result is the updating of the regulations for the hiring of research personnel charged to projects and programs  budget, an action that is already a priority 
for the UDC and that, given the current circumstances, has aroused greater interest on the part of the university community.  
Some unexpected events as the COVID-19 pandemic situation also affected the delay of the elaboration and implementation of this updated regulation.

Are any strategic decisions underway that may influence the action plan? (max 500 words) 
 
All HRS4R guidelines and OTM- R principles are present in the new UDC Strategic Plan for 2022-2026. Some objectives set in the Strategy are 
completely aligned with the HRS4R guidelines. These 2 strategic objectives are: 
 
1. Strategic Objective: Efficient, responsible and transparent management of public resources. 
 
- Operational objective 2. Design and implementation of HRS4R human resources recruitment, selection and promotion programs . 
 
*Action: OE5_Eco_op2_P1: Implementation of the HRS4R Program. 
 
2. Strategic Objective: To improve the processes of selection, promotion and consolidation of the teaching and research staff in the institution, 
favouring the development of its research career. 
- Operational objective 1: To improve the processes of promotion and consolidation of the research staff in the institution. 
        *Action: Elaborate in coordination with all the Vice -rectorates involved, a map of present and future teaching/research needs, to guarantee  
adequate generational change. 
• Operational objective 2: To improve the recruitment of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral researchers. 
      * Action: Coordinate requests for talent recruitment figures with the map of needs drawn up . 
• Operational objective 3: Strengthen support and training services for researchers. 
       *Action: Encourage training courses for researchers and support staff. 
• Operational objective 4: To promote the development of the research career of the PDI belonging to the areas of knowledge in which the need to 
improve the indicators of scientific production is detected. 
      *Action: Review the internal regulations of the UDC, to assess the existence of possible impediments to the development of those areas with 
low scientific output. 
• Operational objective 5: Align staff policies with the guidelines for the HRS4R logo. 
*Action: Adapt the procedures for selecting/hiring researchers to new legislation following the guidelines of the HRS4R logo. 
As the new UDC Strategic Plan is being designed at the same time as the new Action Plan for HRS4R is  being elaborated, the 2 documents need to be 
aligned. The Government Board of the University is an active part of the development of the HR Strategy for Researchers and i s strongly committed to 
embedding all the principles gathered in the Charter and Code in the internal running of the Institution. The Government Board of the University is willing 
to offer all necessary resources to achieve this objective. 
The Strategic Plan for the 2022-2026 period is scheduled to be approved by the Government Board of the UDC in late July and it will be published on the 
UDC website in September.

4. From the direction of the research groups, the needs of each group in this 
area are surveyed. In the event of detection of any unmet need, it is referred to 
those responsible for the information security and data protection units. 
 
5. The Information Security Department of the UDC, which reports directly to the 
Rector, prepares the rules and regulations relating to information security. On its 
website you can consult the various regulations in force, as well as other types 
of documentation. 
 
Besides, for the past 3 years, both the information security director and the data 
protection responsible at the UDC have been providing online and onsite training 
to administration and services staff, as well as to teaching and research staff in 
both subjects. In addition to training, short videos are currently being produced in 
the form of informative pills for self-consumption by researchers interested in this 
matter. 
 
6. The data protection unit has drawn up a data protection guide for research 
that will soon be published on the UDC website. It is pending review and input 
from the Ethics Committee of the UDC, which has recently changed its structure, 
so it has not been possible to finalize it before. It is expected that in the summer 
it will be published on the UDC website.

section for Cultural and Scientific Outreach.   
 
The department manager is Cristina Naya and from there she schedules and 
disseminates many scientific outreach activities.  
 
The UDC and its research centres welcome visits from schoolchildren to its 
facilities, in addition to organizing awareness talks on STEAM professional 
careers for high school students. 
 
They also organize a multitude of dissemination activities open to anyone 
interested, normally taught by researchers from the centre itself but also inviting 
leading researchers in the sector from outside the UDC. 
 
Besides, they organize and take part in many outreach events in order to 
present to society their scientific work and achievements. Some examples are 
the G-Night and the Science Day on the streets.

research activity of its groups. 
 
For this, and following the suggestions received from the State Research 
Agency https://www.aei.gob.es/en (external agent in charge of the evaluation), 
the Office of the Vice-Rector for Scientific Policy, Research and Transfer 
prepared a working document with the guidelines that will regulate the new 
system evaluation.  
 
The Research Commission, delegated by the Governing Council, is the body in 
charge of drawing up the new regulations based on these guidelines. After 
discussing the subject in meetings of the Commission and with a continuous flow 
with the Vice-rectorate, currently, an almost definitive document with the 
approval of the State Research Agency is available, and that will be approved by 
the UDC (and published on the website) in the coming weeks.  
 
KPIs:

Completed Please, note that this action has been merged with action 9 because the 
regulation associated with both actions is directly related and it was considered 
more operative to work on a single regulation that includes both aspects. 
 
In 2019, just before the interim assessment, the former working group along with 
the Research Service elaborated a draft of the OTM-R Policy. The document 
was named “UDC Code of Conduct for the Recruiting of Researchers” and an 
internal draft version was introduced to the EURAXESS evaluators.  
 
In 2021 after reviewing all recommendations from The European Commission on 
the OTM- R principles and after the constitution of a new working group, we 
decided to start again from the beginning and design a package of documents 
that gathers all regulations, principles and good practices regarding OTM- R 
processes. The result is: 
 
- The recently approved and published Regulations of research staff hiring.  
 
-The General Guidelines for research staff recruiting. 
 
- The ongoing preparation of a Guide on Good Practices for the selection and 
hiring of research staff (expected to be completed by June 2023) 
 
- It has also been elaborated a guidelines documents on how to post on 
EURAXESS: to facilitate the task of the people responsible for it.  
                                   
KPIs: 
 
1. Specific focus group for this action is composed of the manager of the 
Research Service and the Deputy to the Vice-Rector for Research.

(HRS4R) for research staff, as well as staff directly related to research 
management, coordination and administration tasks. Also provide training in 
open, transparent and merit-based selection processes (OTM-R) for UDC 
personnel who carry out selection processes. 
 
This training will be regularly reviewed and updated and it will contain an 
important section dedicated to recruitment processes from a gender perspective. 
This specific material will be elaborated on by the Gender Balance Office of the 
UDC and the Vice-rectorate of Equality, Culture and Sports 
. 
To best reach all staff related to recruitment tasks and engage them, this training 
will be available online.

support services, especially EURAXESS and the EURES Network. Referral to 
them in cases that require. 
  
The will of the UDC is to gradually reinforce this point since we consider it to be 
of the utmost importance. In fact, in the new strategic plan for the UDC (currently 
in the drafting phase), appears a strategic objective directly related to the 
creation of a welcome service by the University's International Relations Office. It 
will be especially focused on students and staff from abroad.

and centres of the UDC, in a single centralized space, together with the Vice-
manager of research economic affairs, Yolanda Calaza, who belongs since 2016 
to the HRS4R working group.

Comments on the implementation of the OTM-R principles  
 
The University of A Coruña is strongly committed to the principles of open, transparent and merit -based recruitment, thus over the last months, the Steering 
Committee and the Working Group have made a big effort to bring all suggestions together and elaborate clear, feasible, realistic and easy to implement 
documents. These documents aim to set clear guidelines for all the staff involved in researchers recruiting activities. This includes PI, research group leaders, 
department directors, but also administrative and technical staff from research services.  
  
On the dedicated page for the OTM- Policy you can find several documents related to it: 
1. General guidelines for research staff recruiting at UDC according to OTM-R criteria.  
2. Regulations of research staff hiring.  
3. Guide on Good Practices for the selection and hiring of research staff (expected to be completed and published by June 2023) 
4. Guidelines documents on how to post on EURAXESS. 
 
 
Ideally, the extended version of the reviewed OTM -R policy and actions should be published on your organisation’s website.  
Please provide the web link to the OTM-R dedicated webpage(s) if it is different from the one where the reviewed HR Strategy is located.

1. Implementation 
 
General overview of the expected overall implementation process of the action plan: (max. 1000 words) 
 
The Action P lan for the HRS4R presented by the University of A Coruña (UDC) covers 2017-2022. Since 2019, the implementation process has run with 
different structures and members due to some political changes as both deputies of the Vice-rector for Science Policy, Research and Transfer were substituted 
by another 2 people who were not much aware of the internal management of the HRS4R (deputies in the period from 2016-2019 led the HSR4R application 
process and all management of the project) . So it took some time for the new  composition of the Working Group to restart again with the workflow. Besides, 
the pandemic situation starting in March of 2020 also deeply affected the implementation of the actions and cut off the development of some scheduled actions. 
 
 In 2021 a specific position of HRS4R Manager was created to coordinate the whole process. The main bodies overseeing the process are the Steering 
Committee (SC) and the Working Group (WG), (the new name of the former HR Committee). We have created also four Focus Groups (FG) for specific 
consultations in G ender Balance, OTM- R Procedure, Training and Career Development  and Ethics in Research and T eaching. It is intended, after the 
submission of our HRS4R strategy for evaluation, to continue with this management structure with the SC  and the WG responsible for overseeing the entire 
implementation process, with no major changes in their roles, responsibilities and members.  
 
Thanks to the new role of the HRS4R Manager, who devoted 100% of her time to the coordination and implementation of the Action Plan, UDC has been able 
to streamline all processes and fulfil the vast majority of the action plan, with great effort, in just one and a half years. To ensure that this last implementation 
period and the design of the next Action P lan are in line with what the evaluators will analyze during the study visit, UDC has been supported by an external 
reviewer acting as an auditor of the whole process. This way of working has proved to be effective in meeting the objectives we set ourselves internally at the 
UDC, so we will cons ider extending it for the next Action Plan. In this way, the HRS4R M anager would lead the implementation of the seal of  excellence, 

HRS4R Form | EURAXESS 
30/16 
 
 
coordinating the SC and WG, as well as the FGs when necessary. If needed, the role of an external auditor would continue to be used to ensure the maximum 
effectiveness of the process.  
 
Last but not least, the performance of the University of A Coruña regarding the proposed Action Plan will be evaluated internally every year. To this end, the 
research community will be consulted as it has been done until now and the possibility of extending this consultation to other stakeholders of special interest 
to the UDC, such as the non-academic sector of the region, will be considered. Meanwhile, the HRS4R Manager and the WG are collecting all data regarding 
the progress in the Action Plan and all indicators related, in a dedicated folder within the digital storage system of the UDC (SharePoint tool). Indicators include 
Excel sheets, communications sent, reports, survey results, etc. 
 
Thus, the implementation of the HRS4R seal has been a dynamic and collaborative process, and one w hich will always take into consideration the real 
needs of the R+D+i environment for which the University of A Coruña is a key pillar for its growth and development. 
 
 
 
Make sure you also cover all the aspects highlighted in the checklist, which you will need to describe in detail:  
 
How have you prepared for the internal review? * 
Detailed description and duly justification (max 500 words) 
 
The internal review is something we have been doing steadily throughout the period from 2019 when we passed the previous assessment from EURAXESS 
evaluators. During the last 12 months, we intensified the workflow regarding this project as well as the frequency of the WG meetings.  
 
After Fidel Cacheda and Horacio Naveira,2 of the main project managers of the previous stages of the HRS4R project left the WG, it became a priority to 
provide intensive training to the 2 new members of the Working Group (the team also changed its name, as formerly was named HR Committee). 
 
Once the new WG is constituted the UDC decided to create a new role and recruited a professional with a strong HR in European scenarios background to be 
100% dedicated to this Strategy. Her main responsibilities are to coordinate the participation of all members of the UDC staff directly invol ved in the HRS4R 
development (SC, WG, FGs and other departments from the institution that are key to achieving some actions from the Action Plan). Elaborate on all 
materials related to this project (recruitment procedures, guides, handbooks, presentations). Enhance the awareness of the HRS4R within the UDC 
community, especially among employees, but also students. Strength the communication and outreach. Gather all data and indicator s regarding the stated 
actions for the period 2017-2022 and redact the deliverables for the renewal phase of the HRS4R process. 
 
There is a dedicated space on the SharePoint tool for this WG, where all members can share, edit and consult the documents and data we are working it in 
real-time. We work transparently and collaboratively. We use some tools to facilitate a good communication flow such as Teams from Microsoft to conduct 
meetings and interviews and also to deliver seminars about HRS4R. 
 
Last but not least we would like to highlight that the UDC Government Board is completely aware of the necessity of strengthening the structure of these key 
groups and provide with all necessary resources to its members to ease their task. To that effect, the UDC hired the services of an external expert on HRS4R 
to guide the SC and WG in achieving the set goals and also to act as an external auditor of the whole process.  
 
 
 
 
 

HRS4R Form | EURAXESS

How have you involved the research community, your main stakeholders, in the implementation process? *  
Detailed description and duly justification (max 500 words) 
 
 
The involvement of all the University staff, especially the research community, has been one of the pillars of the last year concerning the implementation of 
HRS4R.  
Over the last months, 10 face-to-face and 4 virtual seminars about the HRS4R have been carried out in the Rectorate Headquarters, and in Zapateira, Elviña, 
and Ferrol Campuses. The target audience of these conferences has been divided into PAS (services and administration staff) and PDI (research and 
teaching staff), and specific conferences and contents have been generated for each target group. In addition, informal talks were held during these events to 
get a first-hand look at the perception of UCD researchers regarding the Action Plan. All suggestions and co mments received from the audience during these 
activities were discussed by the WG members during their meetings and some of them have been the basement for new actions to develop in the new period 
2022-2025. In total 222 people attended the seminars. 
  
As previously said, to complete the info days, a new survey has been launched in March 2022 (which was available until 22nd Apri l 2022) to gather the 
feedback of the research community (we will explain the results in the following section). This survey has been sent to 2004 researchers, research assistants  
and technical staff, (1750 more than in the survey performed in 2016).  
  
Besides, 17 onsite meetings (plus many others held by phone or video call) have been held between the HRS4R manager and some key departments of the 
UDC that are essential for the optimum performance of the stated actions in our HR Strategy, such as Data Protection Dept. Outreach Unit or the 
Communication Service, among others. During these meetings, we deeply explained to our colleagues what exactly the HRS4R is, how are we working on it 
and how they can collaborate to add synergies to get better results and also a higher positive impact on the research communi ty. 
  
Although since 2020 with the COVID-19 crisis has been more difficult to meet personally with our researchers and among the members of the Working Group 
and the Steering Committee, the University of A Coruña has put in place all the tools needed for online work and meetings. A strong effort was made in a very 
short time to provide the university community with digital tools such as Microsoft 365 package, which includes online meetings application Teams, and a 
collaborative space such as SharePoint. These tools allowed researchers to keep in contact with research groups and departments and also to deliver 
seminars, lessons and all kinds of activities in an online format. 
 
 
Do you have an implementation committee and/or steering group regularly overseeing progress? *  
Detailed description and duly justification (max 500 words) 
 
As it has been explained in previous sections, the University of Coruña has a Working Group (Implementation Committee) and the Steering Committee 
responsible for overseeing the entire implementation process . The Working Group is in charge of coordinating the day -to-day actions of the plan and the 
Steering Committee will be the advisory body for decision making. As a minimum, the Working Group meets every 3 months and the Steering Committee 
is appointed twice a year. To lead all the process, the HRS4R Manager  will be 100% devoted to the coordination, monitoring and implementation activities of 
the strategy at UDC.  
 
 
Is there any alignment of organisational policies with the HRS4R? For example, is the HRS4R recogni zed in the organisation’s research strategy, 
overarching HR policy 

HRS4R Form | EURAXESS 
32/16 
 
 
Detailed description and duly justification (max 500 words) 
 
As previously said in the paragraph: “Are any strategic decisions underway that may influence the action plan?”:  
 
All HRS4R guidelines and OTM- R principles are present in the new UDC Strategic Plan for 2022-2026. Some objectives set in the Strategy are completely 
aligned with the HRS4R guidelines. These 2 strategic objectives are: 
 
3. Strategic Objective: Efficient, responsible and transparent management of public resources. 
 
- Operational objective 2. Design and implementation of HRS4R human resources recruitment, selection and promotion programs.  
 
*Action: OE5_Eco_op2_P1: Implementation of the HRS4R Program. 
 
4. Strategic Objective: To improve the processes of selection, promotion and consolidation of the teaching and research staff in the institution, favouring 
the development of its research career. 
- Operational objective 1: To improve the processes of promotion and consolidation of the research staff in the institution.  
        *Action: Elaborate in coordination with all the Vice- rectorates involved, a map of present and future teaching/research needs, to guarantee 
adequate generational change. 
• Operational objective 2: To improve the recruitment of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral researchers. 
      * Action: Coordinate requests for talent recruitment figures with the map of needs drawn up . 
• Operational objective 3: Strengthen support and training services for researchers. 
       *Action: Encourage training courses for researchers and support staff. 
• Operational objective 4 : To promote the development of the research career of the PDI belonging to the areas of knowl edge in which the need to 
improve the indicators of scientific production is detected. 
      *Action: Review the internal regulations of the UDC, to assess the existence of possible impediments to the development of those areas with low 
scientific output. 
• Operational objective 5: Align staff policies with the guidelines for the HRS4R logo. 
*Action: Adapt the procedures for selecting/hiring researchers to new legislation following the guidelines of the HRS4R logo. 
 
As the new UDC Strategic Plan is being designed at the same time as the new Action Plan for HRS4R is being elaborated, the 2 documents need to be 
aligned. The Government Board of the University is an active part of the development of the HR Strategy for Researchers and i s strongly committed to 
embedding all the principles gathered in the Charter and Code in the internal running of the Institution. The Government Board of the University is willing to 
offer all necessary resources to achieve this objective. 
 
The Strategic Plan for the 2022-2026 period is scheduled to be approved by the Government Board of the UDC in late July and it will be published on the 
UDC website in September. 
 

HRS4R Form | EURAXESS 
33/16 
 
 
Also, in a way to raise awareness among the university community on the HRS4R, from the General Management of the University there was an instruction to 
add the HRS4R logo to all email signatures, official documents, and branch websites of the University. This way all the members of the institution were aware 
of the importance of being a holder of the award, what it means and why this reinforces the image of the University in the national and international market.  
 
Last but not least, new regulation regarding research staff recruiting has been carefully designed to be aligned with the OTM- R principles and to keep 
coherence among all documents related to UDC recruiting policies. 
 
How has your organisation ensured that the proposed actions would be also implemented? *  
Detailed description and duly justification (max 500 words) 
 
As it has been explained in previous sections, the University of Coruña put in place a complete internal monitoring system to guarantee the implementation of 
the actions during the last three years, and we will continue using the same system in the next Ac tion Plan. As mentioned before, besides the regular 
meetings and minutes of the meetings of the different committees, we use Excel pages to collect all KPIs corresponding to those includ ed in the Action Plan 
and a system of folders where we compile all the information regarding the implementation of the actions and when needed, we consult external experts to help 
us with the close follow-up and implementation of our internal HRS4R processes.  
 
The main strength of the institution is a good communication flo w among all departments involved in the correct development of the actions set in t he Action 
Plan and the Working Group and HRS4R Manager. This allows getting all indicators needed to measure the level of compliance of each objective.  
 
In those actions that presented more difficulty to be completed, an extra effort was made, involving more actively some key roles within the institution to get the 
achievement, delivering more awareness activities focused on this staff, and conducting more interviews with some managers of key departments to explain 
them more deeply what HRS4R is, what the university must do to get its goals, how this department can support to get the objective, and also to solve doubts 
about the HRS4R procedure and its impact on the University traditional procedures and protocols.

There is a deadline for every action set in the Action Plan. Due to the pandemic situation and also to som e unexpected events that occurred in the previous 
HRS4R WG, some of the deadlines must be postponed.  
 
Since the incorporation of the HRS4R Manager at the University staff, the monitoring has been made both qualitative and quantitative, using several tools to 
measure the advance in the degree of achievement of the stated goals. One of these tools is a Gantt Chart used by the Working Group. 
 
Quantitative indicators are mainly gathered in Excel sheets, collecting for example the number of sessions, seminars and trai ning courses delivered on C& C 
and HRS4R topics, and the number of attendees to each of them (Action 1 and 5). Also, Excel sheets are vastly used to collect all data regarding outreach 
activities (Action 6). 
 
There is also a list where we collect all data regarding infrastructures (Action 11), as some of the centres provided the HRS4R working group with the data 
regarding their infrastructures and available devices on their premises but some already left.  
  
For the next period (Action Plan 2022-2025 ) it would be more operative to set more quantitative indicators for each action so that it would be easier to check 
if goals are being achieved at the right time or if we have to make an extra effort in any action temporarily progressing more slowly than expected.

To monitor the progress in the implementation of the actions stated in the Action Plan 2016-2022, some monitoring tools have recently been adopted. 
 
We use some Excel sheets to gather all figures and data regarding KPIs and other interesting information mainly related to figures. 
 
Also, a Gantt Chart as timing monitoring to get a fast glance of the current situation of each milestone and share this information with both the Steering 
Committee and the Working Group. This is a tool mainly used by the WG in the day a day work. 
 
We also collect data related to meetings, gathering some details regarding them such as the meeting agenda, the minutes, pictures, etc. 
 
Contact details of all key roles of the UDC that are directly or indirectly related to the stated actions are easily available in documents produced by the 
HRS4R implementation manager and stored in the SharePoint tool. 
 
Both the SC and the WG agreed in continuing using these tools during the next period, to collect all KPIs regarding the “in progress” and “new” actions and 
also to keep monitoring the rest of the activities. New methods can be applied during the coming period as the UDC is open to adopting all those resources 
that help monitor the implementation process and make it even clearer, more open and transparent for the whole university community.    
 
How do you expect to prepare for the external review? *

From the very beginning, the University of A Coruña has faithfully followed the updates of the EURAXESS e-tool Guidelines for Institutions regarding the 
different phases of the evaluation of the seal of excellence. The Working Group has been up to date on all news concerning the HRS4R application and 
renewal phases. As part of the preparation and to get an excellent result we have taken into consideration all suggestions that were given by HRS4R experts 
on EURAXESS webinars, also in recorded speeches in other HRS4R holder institutions, reading as much as possible about HRS4R procedures in other 
reference institutions to learn from their good practices. Also following specialized content and profiles on Social Media such as LinkedIn and Twitter. 
 
During the present Action Plan, specific communication actions to actively involve the research community (info days and meetings as previously explained) 
have been put in place. We want our researchers to feel not simply as mere recipients of the policies implemented at the University of A Coruña, but as an 
active part of this work.  
 
At the time of the external evaluation, the assessors will have to meet with both the Working Group and Steering Committee and researchers at all levels 
(R1-R4). Through this real involvement, as well as further improving our overall communication about the HRS4R strategy at UDC, we believe that our 
preparation for the external evaluation is stronger.  
 
Moreover, the main issue to be judged at that time will be the actual embedding of OTM-R Policies at UDC. Through our OTM-R Policy, already approved as 
part of the Action Plan that is now ending, together with specific actions included in the Action Plan aimed at studying the University of A Coruña’s Plans 
and how to embed all these policies in the day-to-day life of the university, we believe that we are also laying the foundations for a successful external 
evaluation. 
 
As already mentioned, our work with external experts is very helpful to us in order not to deviate from our focus, so in this case, we will work again with 
these profiles to carry out an external evaluation before the visit of the evaluators.
