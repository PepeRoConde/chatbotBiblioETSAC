External Internships
The academic internships corresponding to the degree programmes of the SNSME in:
Bachelor’s Degree in Marine Engineering / Marine Technologies – Energy and Propulsion Track (Marine Engineer).
Bachelor’s Degree in Marine Engineering / Marine Technologies – Electro-Technical Officer Track (Electro Technical Officer – ETO).
Bachelor’s Degree in Nautical Science and Maritime Transport – Ship Nautical Operations (Deck Officer).
constitute a very important part of student training and, in this regard, are considered core subjects in the 4th year of all specialisations.
To this end, this internship period comprises a set of activities that, in addition to completing the student’s academic training, also serve to:
Familiarise the student with life in the maritime environment.
Assess their ability and the effective use of the knowledge acquired.
Verify their understanding of such knowledge.
Initiate their professional career, considering that these internships are recognised by the DGMM.
Given these objectives and in accordance with the provisions established for the aforementioned degrees, the internships will share a common orientation in their design, but must be adapted in each case to the specific professional profile pursued.

SNSME External Internships Regulation – Ed. 2025
The School of Nautical Science and Marine Engineering (SNSME) of the University of A Coruña, within the scope of its responsibilities in academic planning and coordination, considers it necessary to establish its own regulatory framework to govern the development of external internships for its students.
External internships constitute an essential training activity aimed at acquiring professional competencies in a real working environment, serving as a bridge between university education and professional practice. They also represent a key element in strengthening the relationship between the SNSME and the maritime, industrial, and business sectors, as well as in improving students’ employability.
This Regulation sets out the framework for the organisation, management, monitoring, and assessment of external internships in the degree programmes offered by the SNSME, integrating their implementation into the School’s Internal Quality Assurance System (IQAS) and adapting to the current regulations of the University of A Coruña and the applicable national legislation.

Students shall have an assigned TA and TP, who will perform the same guidance, monitoring, and assessment functions described in this Regulation, adapted to the nature and duration of the placement.
At the end of the placement, students must submit an abbreviated report, descriptive and reflective in nature, adapted to the duration and characteristics of the placement. This report shall follow a simplified format compared to the curricular placement report and must include, at minimum, a description of the tasks performed and a brief personal reflection on the experience. It must be accompanied by the corresponding assessments from the TA and TP, following the procedure established by the CPE.
Extracurricular placements do not count towards the compulsory credits of the degree, but they may appear in the European Diploma Supplement (extra) and in the academic transcript as a recognised training activity.
The CPE may exceptionally authorise, with due justification, the subsequent recognition of an extracurricular placement as curricular, provided it meets the training objectives, minimum duration, and requirements of the degree programme.
The CPE shall maintain a specific register of extracurricular placements and shall include aggregated information on these in the annual results and continuous improvement report.
In all cases, extracurricular placements shall be subject to the same principles of equality, non-discrimination, safety, confidentiality, and respect for human dignity as curricular placements.
CHAPTER IV. Assessment
IV. General principles of assessment
The assessment of external internships shall have a formative and certifying nature, and its purpose is to verify the degree of acquisition of the professional, technical and transversal competencies defined in the study plans and in the approved training project.
The assessment process shall ensure the principles of objectivity, transparency and traceability, guaranteeing equal treatment and equal opportunities for all students.
The assessment will be carried out by the TP and the TA, in accordance with the official rubrics included in Annexes III and IV of this Regulation.
The assessment process will consider both technical-professional performance and the student’s attitudes, behaviour, and ability to integrate into the work environment.
In no case may internship assessment be based exclusively on attendance or time spent, but on the effective acquisition of the defined training competencies.
