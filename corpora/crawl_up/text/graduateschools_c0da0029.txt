Graduate Schools
“ Graduate Schools are an essential mechanism for showcasing UPCité’s disciplinary excellence and its interdisciplinary dynamic. By displaying the strength of the master-doctorate continuum and the importance of training by and for research, the Graduate Schools position UPCité at the highest international standards. ” Édouard Kaminski, President of Université Paris Cité
Our master’s and doctoral programmes are thoughtfully crafted to provide cross-disciplinary instruction rooted in multidisciplinary research. This approach aims to equip students with the skills to address modern scientific challenges, including advancing open science, promoting ethical and scientific integrity, and integrating sustainability principles into their academic pursuits.
