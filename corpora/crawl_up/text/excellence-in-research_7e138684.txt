→ HRS4R labelling process
What is the HRS4R label?
Awarded by the European Commission, the ‘HR Excellence in Research’ label is based on the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers published in 2005 (provide access link). The HRS4R reference framework is made up of 40 principles (provide access link) based on four main themes: Ethical principles and professional responsibilities; Recruitment, career development and mobility; Working and safety conditions, professional environment; Training.
Why commit to an HRS4R labelling process?

Open, transparent, and merit-based recruitment (OTM-R) policy
Université Paris Cité is strongly committed to continuously improving working conditions and mobility for researchers, particularly through the implementation of an HRS4R certification strategy. This initiative is a core element of our Open, Transparent, and Merit-Based Recruitment (OTM-R) policy, ensuring fair recruitment processes based on ethics, inclusion, and equal opportunities. These commitments enhance the university’s global appeal and ensure recognition of the quality of the talents it attracts.
